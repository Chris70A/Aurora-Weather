## Description

Travelers can use this weather dashboard to view the forecast for several cities and plan their vacations appropriately.

- The goal of this project was to give users a simple user interface that accurately displayed weather data for whichever city they selected.
- This weather dashboard allows travelers to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, helping them plan their trips accordingly.
- It also eliminates the need to manually check numerous weather sources while making travel plans. 
- The development of this project taught us how to use the DOM, the OpenWeather API, and localStorage to store permanent data.
